AdobeOggM1
========

Extremely rough fixes to get AdobeOgg to compile and run on native Apple Silicon

Download
--------
Download the latest (and likely only) build [here](https://github.com/Coolguy1260/AdobeOggM1/releases/download/v0.5b6_m1/Ogg.Premiere.zip)

Other Notes
-----------
I did not rename the folder used for the Premiere SDK, even though the latest Premiere Pro SDK is required to be downloaded, it still goes in the "Premiere Pro CS5 Mac SDK" folder.
